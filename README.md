crypto-chat
=====================

Encrypted chat implemented using the [Web Crypto API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), and Dan Abramov's [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux).

Seeded from [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate). The rest is mine, with thanks to the [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/) community for their help.

*N.B. This example is heavily under construction and will not be stable for a while. The live demo is for entertainment purposes only.*
